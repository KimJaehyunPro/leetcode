### LeetCode Problem: 2356. Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** SQL, Pandas

---

#### Table Schema: Teacher

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| teacher_id  | int  |
| subject_id  | int  |
| dept_id     | int  |

- **Primary Key:** (subject_id, dept_id)
- **Description:** Each row in this table indicates that the teacher with `teacher_id` teaches the subject `subject_id` in the department `dept_id`.

---

### Problem Statement

Write a solution to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university. Return the result table in any order.

---

### Example 1

**Input:**

Teacher Table:
| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |

**Output:**

| teacher_id | cnt |
|------------|-----|
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |

**Explanation:**

- **Teacher 1**: 
  - Teaches subject 2 in departments 3 and 4.
  - Teaches subject 3 in department 3.
  - **Total Unique Subjects:** 2

- **Teacher 2**:
  - Teaches subject 1 in department 1.
  - Teaches subject 2 in department 1.
  - Teaches subject 3 in department 1.
  - Teaches subject 4 in department 1.
  - **Total Unique Subjects:** 4

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;
```

- **Explanation**: This SQL query groups the data by `teacher_id`, counts the distinct `subject_id` values for each teacher, and returns the result.

---

### Pandas Solution

```python
import pandas as pd

def count_unique_subjects(teacher: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df = teacher.groupby(["teacher_id"])["subject_id"].nunique().reset_index()
    df = df.rename({'subject_id': 'cnt'}, axis=1)
    return df
```

- **Explanation**: This Python function groups the DataFrame by `teacher_id`, counts the unique `subject_id` values for each teacher, and renames the column to `cnt`.
