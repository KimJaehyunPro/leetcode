# Recyclable and Low Fat Products

**Table: Products**

| Column Name | Type  |
|-------------|-------|
| product_id  | int   |
| low_fats    | enum  |
| recyclable  | enum  |

- **product_id** is the primary key.
- **low_fats** is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means the product is low fat.
- **recyclable** is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means the product is recyclable.

## Problem Statement:
Write a solution to find the IDs of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

### Example:

Input:
| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 0          | Y        | N          |
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |
| 4          | N        | N          |

Output:
| product_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 3          |

### Solution:

```sql
SELECT product_id 
FROM Products 
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
