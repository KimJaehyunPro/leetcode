[Snakes and Ladders](https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

## Problem: Snakes and Ladders

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `board` where the cells are labeled from `1` to `n^2` in a Boustrophedon style starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e., `board[n - 1][0]`) and alternating direction each row.

You start on square `1` of the board. In each move, starting from square `curr`, you do the following:

- Choose a destination square `next` with a label in the range `[curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n^2)]`. This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.
- If `next` has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to `next`.
- The game ends when you reach the square `n^2`.

A board square on row `r` and column `c` has a snake or ladder if `board[r][c] != -1`. The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`. Squares `1` and `n^2` are not the starting points of any snake or ladder.

**Note**: You only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination of a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.

### Example 1:

**Input**:
```python
board = [
  [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
  [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
  [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
  [-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],
  [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
  [-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]
]
```

**Output**: `4`

**Explanation**:
- In the beginning, you start at square `1` (at row `5`, column `0`).
- You decide to move to square `2` and must take the ladder to square `15`.
- You then decide to move to square `17` and must take the snake to square `13`.
- You then decide to move to square `14` and must take the ladder to square `35`.
- You then decide to move to square `36`, ending the game.
- This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return `4`.

### Example 2:

**Input**:
```python
board = [[-1,-1],[-1,3]]
```

**Output**: `1`

### Constraints:

- `n == board.length == board[i].length`
- `2 <= n <= 20`
- `board[i][j]` is either `-1` or in the range `[1, n^2]`.
- The squares labeled `1` and `n^2` are not the starting points of any snake or ladder.

## Solution (I couldn't solve it )

```python
class Solution:
    def snakesAndLadders(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(board)  # Size of the board (n x n)
        flattened_board = []  # To store the flattened version of the board in 1D
        board_positions = []  # To store the actual positions after considering snakes and ladders
        
        # Flatten the board while maintaining the Boustrophedon order
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 1:
                # Reverse the row if it's an odd-numbered row (from the bottom)
                board[n - i - 1].reverse()
            # Add the row to the flattened board
            flattened_board += board[n - i - 1]
        
        # Create the board_positions array that maps the flattened board to the game positions
        for i in range(n ** 2):
            if flattened_board[i] != -1:
                # If there's a snake or ladder, move to the destination square
                board_positions.append(flattened_board[i])
            else:
                # If no snake or ladder, stay on the current square
                board_positions.append(i + 1)

        # Initialize the BFS queue with the starting position (square 1)
        queue = [board_positions[0]]
        visited = set()  # Set to track visited positions
        visited.add(board_positions[0])
        move_count = 0  # Counter for the number of moves taken
        last_pos = board_positions[0]  # To track the last processed position in the current level of BFS

        # BFS loop to explore the board
        while queue:
            current_pos = queue.pop(0)  # Get the current position from the queue
            # Calculate the possible next positions from current_pos (up to 6 moves ahead)
            next_positions = board_positions[current_pos: current_pos + 6]
            
            # Check if the last square (n^2) is within the next possible positions
            if n ** 2 in next_positions:
                return move_count + 1  # If yes, return the number of moves taken to reach it
            
            # Process each possible next position
            for next_pos in next_positions:
                if next_pos not in visited:  # If the position hasn't been visited yet
                    queue.append(next_pos)  # Add it to the BFS queue
                    visited.add(next_pos)  # Mark it as visited
            
            # If we've processed all possible moves at the current level, increment the move count
            if last_pos == current_pos and queue:
                last_pos = queue[-1]  # Update the last processed position
                move_count += 1  # Increment the move count since we're moving to a new level in BFS

        return -1  # If we exhaust the queue without reaching the last square, return -1 (unreachable)
```

### Explanation of How the Solution Works:

1. **Flattening the Board (`flattened_board`)**:
   - The board is initially a 2D list representing the game in a grid format. To simplify movement across the board, it is converted into a 1D list (`flattened_board`). This conversion respects the Boustrophedon pattern, which alternates direction across rows.

2. **Mapping Board Positions (`board_positions`)**:
   - After flattening the board, we create an array (`board_positions`) where each index corresponds to a square on the board. If a square has a ladder or snake, the destination is stored in `board_positions`. If itâ€™s a regular square, it simply points to itself.

3. **BFS Initialization**:
   - The BFS begins at the first square (`board_positions[0]`). The BFS queue keeps track of all potential positions you can move to with the minimum number of moves.
   - The `visited` set ensures that each square is visited only once to avoid redundant work.

4. **BFS Loop**:
   - The BFS loop processes each position by considering the next possible moves (1 to 6 squares ahead). 
   - If moving to a position lands on a snake or ladder, BFS is updated to reflect the destination of that snake or ladder.
   - The algorithm checks if the final square (`n^2`) is reached within the next possible positions. If it is, it returns the total number of moves taken.

5. **Tracking BFS Levels**:
   - `move_count` tracks the number of BFS levels, essentially counting the number of moves taken.
   - `last_pos` tracks the last processed position at the current BFS level. When all positions at the current level are processed, `move_count` is incremented.

6. **Termination**:
   - The BFS continues until the queue is empty or the last square (`n^2`) is reached. If the last square is reached, the function returns the number of moves taken. If not, it returns `-1`, indicating that the destination is unreachable.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and finds the minimum number of moves required to win the game, considering both the snakes and ladders present on the board.
