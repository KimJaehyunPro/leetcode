## Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, your task is to find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If no such subarray exists, return `0`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** `target = 7`, `nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** The subarray `[4, 3]` is the shortest subarray with a sum that meets or exceeds the target.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** `target = 4`, `nums = [1, 4, 4]`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** The subarray `[4]` has a sum equal to the target and is the shortest possible.

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** `target = 11`, `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- **Output:** `0`
- **Explanation:** No subarray sums to 11 or more.

### Constraints

- `1 <= target <= 10^9`
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

### Follow-up

If you solve the problem in O(n) time, try implementing an alternative solution with a time complexity of O(n log n).

### Current Solution

The provided solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        subarray_length = 1
        len_nums = len(nums)

        while subarray_length <= len_nums: 
            starting_idx = 0

            while (starting_idx + subarray_length) <= len_nums:
                sum = 0

                for i in range(subarray_length):
                    sum += nums[starting_idx + i]

                    if sum >= target:
                        return subarray_length

                starting_idx += 1
            
            subarray_length += 1

        return 0
```

#### Issue with Current Approach

The current solution results in a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\). This inefficiency arises from the nested loops that check all possible subarrays of increasing length and sum their elements repeatedly. This approach is not practical for large arrays with up to \(10^5\) elements.

### Optimized Solution

To solve this problem efficiently, you can use the **sliding window** technique, which achieves \(O(n)\) time complexity. This method involves maintaining a dynamic window with two pointers and adjusting the window size to find the minimal length subarray that meets the condition.

Here's an optimized implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        left = 0
        current_sum = 0
        min_length = float('inf')

        for right in range(n):
            current_sum += nums[right]

            while current_sum >= target:
                min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
                current_sum -= nums[left]
                left += 1

        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0
```

### Explanation:

1. **Two Pointers (Sliding Window)**:
    - **Right Pointer**: Expands the window by moving to the right.
    - **Left Pointer**: Contracts the window from the left when the sum of the window meets or exceeds the target.

2. **Update Minimum Length**:
    - Update the minimal length whenever the sum of the current window is greater than or equal to the target.

3. **Time Complexity**:
    - The algorithm operates in \(O(n)\) time, as each element is processed at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer).

This optimized approach efficiently handles large inputs and avoids the time limit exceeded error.
