### Problem: Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topic:** Backtracking  
**Accepted Submissions:** 2.2M  
**Acceptance Rate:** 61.6%

#### Problem Description
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

The mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that the digit '1' does not map to any letters.

#### Digit to Letter Mapping:
- '2': "abc"
- '3': "def"
- '4': "ghi"
- '5': "jkl"
- '6': "mno"
- '7': "pqrs"
- '8': "tuv"
- '9': "wxyz"

#### Examples:

**Example 1:**
```
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: digits = ""
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
```

#### Constraints:
- `0 <= digits.length <= 4`
- `digits[i]` is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

### Solutions

#### My Initial Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        
        digit_letter_match = {
            '2': ['a', 'b', 'c'],
            '3': ['d', 'e', 'f'],
            '4': ['g', 'h', 'i'],
            '5': ['j', 'k', 'l'],
            '6': ['m', 'n', 'o'],
            '7': ['p', 'q', 'r', 's'],
            '8': ['t', 'u', 'v'],
            '9': ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
        }

        combinations = []

        if not digits:
            return combinations

        combinations += digit_letter_match[digits[0]]

        for digit in digits[1:]:
            letters = digit_letter_match[digit]

            next_combinations = []
            for current_combination in combinations:
                for letter in letters:
                    next_combinations.append(current_combination + letter)
            
            combinations = next_combinations

        return combinations
```

#### Improved Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        if not digits:
            return []
        
        digit_to_letters = {
            '2': 'abc',
            '3': 'def',
            '4': 'ghi',
            '5': 'jkl',
            '6': 'mno',
            '7': 'pqrs',
            '8': 'tuv',
            '9': 'wxyz'
        }
        
        queue = ['']
        
        for digit in digits:
            letters = digit_to_letters[digit]
            new_queue = []
            
            for combination in queue:
                for letter in letters:
                    new_queue.append(combination + letter)
            
            queue = new_queue
        
        return queue
```

### Summary

This problem requires generating all possible letter combinations that can be formed by the digits of a phone number using a given mapping. The initial approach builds the combinations incrementally, but the improved solution is more efficient by utilizing a queue, which allows for cleaner and more concise code.

The "better solution" provided is more efficient and concise for a few key reasons:

### 1. **Use of Strings Instead of Lists:**
   - **Your Solution:** You use lists to store the possible letters for each digit, e.g., `'2': ['a', 'b', 'c']`.
   - **Better Solution:** Instead, it uses strings, e.g., `'2': 'abc'`.
   
   **Why This Matters:** 
   - Accessing elements in a string is slightly faster and more memory-efficient than accessing elements in a list because strings are more lightweight.
   - Additionally, using strings reduces the complexity of the dictionary creation and makes the operations on the characters (like concatenation) more direct.

### 2. **Queue-Based Approach:**
   - **Your Solution:** You iterate over each digit and manually build new combinations by looping through all existing combinations and appending each letter to them.
   - **Better Solution:** Uses a queue to maintain combinations, and for each digit, it extends each combination by appending all possible letters corresponding to that digit.
   
   **Why This Matters:**
   - The queue approach is more streamlined and better suited for problems where you build sequences iteratively. It effectively handles the combination logic with fewer lines of code and operations.
   - It avoids the need to create and manage intermediate lists like `next_combinations`, leading to less overhead in terms of memory management and execution time.

### 3. **Efficiency in Managing Combinations:**
   - **Your Solution:** Builds new lists for each step and replaces the existing list of combinations at every step. This involves creating and destroying lists repeatedly.
   - **Better Solution:** Directly manipulates the queue, which simplifies memory operations and reduces the overhead associated with list operations.
   
   **Why This Matters:**
   - By using a queue and avoiding the creation of temporary lists, the better solution reduces memory usage and potentially decreases the number of operations, which can lead to faster execution.

### **Why the Better Solution is Faster:**
- **Fewer Memory Operations:** The better solution minimizes the creation of intermediate lists and relies on string operations and a simple queue, which are generally faster.
- **Reduced Overhead:** By eliminating unnecessary lists and using more efficient data structures, the overall execution time is reduced.
- **Simplified Logic:** The queue-based approach results in less complex logic, which often translates into better performance due to reduced computational overhead.

### Summary:
The better solution is faster because it optimizes memory usage, reduces unnecessary operations, and employs a more efficient way to manage and build the combinations using a queue and string operations. These improvements make the algorithm more streamlined and better performing, especially for larger input sizes.
