##### **200. Number of Islands**  
*Difficulty: Medium*

---

**Problem Description:**

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` that represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An island is defined as a group of connected lands (`'1'`s) surrounded by water, connected either horizontally or vertically. You may assume that all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

---

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```python
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

---

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

---

### **Solution:**

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        number_of_islands = 0

        rows_len = len(grid)
        columns_len = len(grid[0])

        def remove_land(row_idx, column_idx):            
            if (rows_len <= row_idx) or (row_idx < 0) or (columns_len <= column_idx) or (column_idx < 0) or (grid[row_idx][column_idx] == "0"): 
                return
            
            grid[row_idx][column_idx] = "0"

            # Remove northern cell
            remove_land(row_idx - 1, column_idx)

            # Remove southern cell
            remove_land(row_idx + 1, column_idx)

            # Remove eastern cell
            remove_land(row_idx, column_idx - 1)

            # Remove western cell
            remove_land(row_idx, column_idx + 1)

        for row_idx in range(rows_len):
            for column_idx in range(columns_len):
                if (grid[row_idx][column_idx] == "0"): 
                    continue
                number_of_islands += 1
                remove_land(row_idx, column_idx)

        return number_of_islands
```
