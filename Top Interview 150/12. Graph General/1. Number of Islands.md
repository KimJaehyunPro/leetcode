##### **200. Number of Islands**  
*Difficulty: Medium*

---

**Problem Description:**

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` that represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An island is defined as a group of connected lands (`'1'`s) surrounded by water, connected either horizontally or vertically. You may assume that all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

---

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```python
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

---

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

---

### **Solution:**

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        number_of_islands = 0

        rows_len = len(grid)
        columns_len = len(grid[0])

        def remove_land(row_idx, column_idx):            
            if (rows_len <= row_idx) or (row_idx < 0) or (columns_len <= column_idx) or (column_idx < 0) or (grid[row_idx][column_idx] == "0"): 
                return
            
            grid[row_idx][column_idx] = "0"

            # Remove northern cell
            remove_land(row_idx - 1, column_idx)

            # Remove southern cell
            remove_land(row_idx + 1, column_idx)

            # Remove eastern cell
            remove_land(row_idx, column_idx - 1)

            # Remove western cell
            remove_land(row_idx, column_idx + 1)

        for row_idx in range(rows_len):
            for column_idx in range(columns_len):
                if (grid[row_idx][column_idx] == "0"): 
                    continue
                number_of_islands += 1
                remove_land(row_idx, column_idx)

        return number_of_islands
```

Your solution is generally well-structured and works correctly for the problem. However, there are a few optimizations and improvements that can be made to increase efficiency and readability:

### 1. **Avoiding Repeated Function Calls:**
   - The `remove_land` function recursively calls itself for each adjacent cell (north, south, east, west). While this is correct, it can be optimized by using a stack-based Depth-First Search (DFS) approach instead of recursion, which can reduce the overhead of repeated function calls.

### 2. **Avoid Modifying the Input Grid:**
   - Instead of modifying the grid in place, you could use a visited array to keep track of visited cells. This makes the code clearer and avoids side effects, especially if the input grid needs to be preserved.

### 3. **Stack-Based DFS:**
   - The stack-based DFS approach replaces the recursion with an explicit stack. This is generally more efficient in Python, where recursion depth can be a limitation.

Here is the optimized version of your solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0

        number_of_islands = 0
        rows_len = len(grid)
        columns_len = len(grid[0])
        visited = [[False for _ in range(columns_len)] for _ in range(rows_len)]

        def dfs(row_idx, column_idx):
            stack = [(row_idx, column_idx)]
            while stack:
                r, c = stack.pop()
                if (r < 0 or r >= rows_len or c < 0 or c >= columns_len or grid[r][c] == '0' or visited[r][c]):
                    continue
                visited[r][c] = True
                # Push all adjacent cells onto the stack
                stack.append((r - 1, c))  # north
                stack.append((r + 1, c))  # south
                stack.append((r, c - 1))  # west
                stack.append((r, c + 1))  # east

        for row_idx in range(rows_len):
            for column_idx in range(columns_len):
                if grid[row_idx][column_idx] == '1' and not visited[row_idx][column_idx]:
                    number_of_islands += 1
                    dfs(row_idx, column_idx)

        return number_of_islands
```

### **Why is this solution better?**

1. **Avoids Recursive Call Overhead:** By using an explicit stack instead of recursion, we eliminate the risk of hitting the recursion depth limit in Python, which can happen in cases of large grids. This also tends to be faster and more memory-efficient.

2. **Improves Readability and Maintainability:** Using a `visited` array makes the code clearer and avoids modifying the input grid, which is a good practice. It ensures the function's behavior is more predictable and easier to debug.

3. **Explicit Control over Stack:** The explicit control over the stack allows better management of the cells that need to be visited, and it prevents potential stack overflows that can occur with deep recursion.

Overall, this approach is more robust and scalable, especially for larger grids, making it a more optimized solution for the problem.
