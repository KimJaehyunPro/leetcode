### Problem 36: Valid Sudoku

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Description:**

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

**Note:**
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**

- **Input:**
  ```python
  board = [
      ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
      ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
      [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
      ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
      ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
      ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
      [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
      [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
      [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
  ]
  ```
- **Output:** `true`

**Example 2:**

- **Input:**
  ```python
  board = [
      ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
      ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
      [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
      ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
      ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
      ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
      [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
      [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
      [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
  ]
  ```
- **Output:** `false`
- **Explanation:** Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

### Solution

#### Initial Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        def is_valid_digits(digits):
            written_digits = set()
            for digit in digits:
                if not digit.isdigit():
                    continue
                if digit in written_digits:
                    return False
                written_digits.add(digit)
            return True

        # Check if rows are valid
        for i in range(9):
            row_digits = [board[i][j] for j in range(9)]
            if not is_valid_digits(row_digits):
                return False

        # Check if columns are valid
        for i in range(9):
            column_digits = [board[j][i] for j in range(9)]
            if not is_valid_digits(column_digits):
                return False

        # Check if 3x3 grids are valid
        for grid_row in range(3):
            for grid_column in range(3):
                root_row_idx = grid_row * 3
                root_column_idx = grid_column * 3
                grid = [board[root_row_idx + r][root_column_idx + c] for r in range(3) for c in range(3)]
                if not is_valid_digits(grid):
                    return False

        return True
```

**Runtime:** 41 ms

**Explanation:** This solution checks the validity of rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids by using helper functions and iterating through the board.

#### Optimized Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValidSudoku(self, board):
        res = []
        for i in range(9):
            for j in range(9):
                element = board[i][j]
                if element != '.':
                    res += [(i, element), (element, j), (i // 3, j // 3, element)]
        return len(res) == len(set(res))
```

### Optimized Solution Explanation:

The optimized solution to validate a Sudoku board focuses on ensuring that each number appears only once in its respective row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid. This is accomplished by leveraging Python's `set` data structure, which inherently handles duplicates.

#### Key Idea:
The core idea is to represent the constraints of the Sudoku board (rows, columns, and sub-grids) using tuples and then check for uniqueness by using a set. If any number violates the uniqueness rule in any row, column, or sub-grid, the length of the list of tuples will not match the length of the set of tuples.

### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - An empty list `res` is created to store tuples representing the row, column, and sub-grid constraints for each non-empty cell.

2. **Iterating Through the Board:**
   - The code iterates over each cell in the 9x9 board using two nested loops, where `i` is the row index and `j` is the column index.
   - For each cell, if the cell is not empty (i.e., it does not contain `'.'`), the value of the cell is stored in the variable `element`.

3. **Creating Tuples for Constraints:**
   - Three tuples are created and added to the `res` list for each valid (non-empty) cell:
     - **Row Constraint:** `(i, element)` — This tuple ensures that the `element` is unique in the `i`-th row.
     - **Column Constraint:** `(element, j)` — This tuple ensures that the `element` is unique in the `j`-th column.
     - **Sub-grid Constraint:** `(i // 3, j // 3, element)` — This tuple ensures that the `element` is unique in the 3x3 sub-grid. The expression `i // 3` and `j // 3` calculate the index of the 3x3 sub-grid by dividing the row and column indices by 3.

4. **Uniqueness Check Using a Set:**
   - After collecting all the tuples in `res`, the solution converts the list `res` to a set and compares the length of the set with the length of the original list.
   - If there are no duplicates, the lengths will match, and the function returns `True`, indicating that the Sudoku board is valid.
   - If there are duplicates, the lengths will differ, and the function returns `False`.

### Optimized Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board):
        res = []
        for i in range(9):
            for j in range(9):
                element = board[i][j]
                if element != '.':
                    res += [(i, element), (element, j), (i // 3, j // 3, element)]
        return len(res) == len(set(res))
```

### Example Walkthrough:

Consider the example board:

```python
board = [
    ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
    ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
    [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
    ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
    ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
    ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
    [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
    [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
    [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
```

- For the first element "5" at position (0,0):
  - The tuples generated would be `(0, '5')`, `('5', 0)`, and `(0, 0, '5')`.
- As the iteration continues, more tuples are added to `res`, representing each non-empty cell's constraints.

### Advantages of the Optimized Solution:

- **Efficiency:** The use of a set for checking uniqueness is efficient because checking for membership in a set is an \(O(1)\) operation.
- **Conciseness:** The code is compact and avoids the need for multiple loops to check rows, columns, and sub-grids separately.
- **Scalability:** The approach handles all constraints in a unified manner, making it easier to maintain and understand.

This optimized solution efficiently checks if the given Sudoku board is valid by leveraging Python's data structures and ensures that the validation process is both fast and clear.
