## Problem: Valid Parentheses

### Problem Description:
Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

A string is considered valid if:
1. Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
3. Every closing bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `s = "()"`  
- **Output:** `true`

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `s = "()[]{}"`  
- **Output:** `true`

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** `s = "(]"`  
- **Output:** `false`

**Example 4:**
- **Input:** `s = "([])"`  
- **Output:** `true`

## Your Original Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []

        for parentheses in s:
            if parentheses in '({[':
                stack.append(parentheses)

            elif parentheses in ')}]':
                if len(stack) == 0:
                    return False
                top_parentheses = stack[-1]
                if (top_parentheses == '(' and parentheses != ')') or \
                   (top_parentheses == '{' and parentheses != '}') or \
                   (top_parentheses == '[' and parentheses != ']'):
                    return False
                
                stack.pop()

        return len(stack) == 0
```

### Explanation:
1. **Stack Usage**: The solution uses a stack to keep track of open brackets.
2. **Iteration Over Characters**: It iterates through the string `s`:
   - **Open Brackets**: If a character is an open bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, `'['`), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - **Close Brackets**: If a character is a close bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, `']'`), the solution checks:
     - If the stack is empty, it returns `False`.
     - It checks if the top of the stack matches the corresponding open bracket. If not, it returns `False`.
     - If they match, it pops the top of the stack.
3. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, the solution returns `True` if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets were matched); otherwise, it returns `False`.

## Better Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}

        for char in s:
            if char in mapping.values():
                stack.append(char)
            elif char in mapping.keys():
                if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():
                    return False
        
        return not stack
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mapping Dictionary**: The solution uses a dictionary `mapping` where the keys are close brackets and the values are the corresponding open brackets.
2. **Simplified Logic**:
   - **Push Open Brackets**: If a character is an open bracket (found in `mapping.values()`), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - **Match Close Brackets**: If a character is a close bracket (found in `mapping.keys()`):
     - The solution checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack doesn't match the corresponding open bracket using `mapping`. If either condition fails, it returns `False`.
   - **Final Check**: The solution returns `True` if the stack is empty, indicating all brackets were matched properly.

### Why the Better Solution is Better:
1. **Cleaner and More Readable**: The use of the `mapping` dictionary makes the code cleaner by removing the need for multiple `if-elif` conditions. This simplifies bracket matching and makes the logic easier to follow.
2. **Reduced Conditionals**: The original solution uses multiple conditionals to match each type of bracket, which can be error-prone and harder to maintain. The better solution reduces this to a simple dictionary lookup and comparison, making the code more efficient.
3. **Scalability**: If additional types of brackets were introduced, only the `mapping` dictionary would need to be updated, and the core logic would remain unchanged.

## Further Improved Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []

        parenthesis_dict = {
            "(": ")",
            "{": "}",
            "[": "]"
        }

        opening_parenthesis = parenthesis_dict.keys()
        closing_parenthesis = parenthesis_dict.values()

        for parentheses in s:
            if parentheses in opening_parenthesis:
                stack.append(parentheses)

            elif parentheses in closing_parenthesis:
                if not stack: 
                    return False

                top_parentheses = stack.pop()
                if parentheses != parenthesis_dict[top_parentheses]:
                    return False

        return not stack
```

### Explanation:
1. **Parenthesis Dictionary**: This solution uses a dictionary `parenthesis_dict` to map open brackets to their corresponding close brackets.
2. **Stack Management**: 
   - **Push Open Brackets**: If the character is an open bracket, it is pushed onto the stack.
   - **Match Close Brackets**: If the character is a close bracket:
     - The solution checks if the stack is empty (indicating no corresponding open bracket).
     - It pops the top of the stack and checks if it matches the expected closing bracket using the dictionary.
     - If they donâ€™t match, it returns `False`.
3. **Final Check**: The solution returns `True` if the stack is empty, indicating all brackets were matched properly.

### Why This Solution is Better:
1. **Logical Structure**: This solution retains the benefits of the previous better solution but organizes the code to explicitly define opening and closing parentheses, improving code readability and making the intention clear.
2. **Stack Handling**: It directly pops from the stack when matching close brackets, which is both efficient and reduces the need for unnecessary checks.
3. **Simplified Conditions**: The logic is further simplified by directly using the dictionary for matching, reducing the complexity of the conditionals.

## Summary:
- **Original Solution**: Works well but has more complex and redundant conditions, making it slightly harder to maintain.
- **Better Solution**: Simplifies the logic using a dictionary for matching brackets, making it cleaner and more efficient.
- **Further Improved Solution**: Builds on the better solution by structuring the code in a way that improves readability and clarity while maintaining efficiency.

### The Best Approach:
The best approach is to use the **Better Solution** with the `mapping` dictionary or the **Further Improved Solution**. These approaches offer a balance of readability, maintainability, and efficiency, making them ideal for solving the problem of validating parentheses in strings.
