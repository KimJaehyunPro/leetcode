## 70. Climbing Stairs

### Description

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 step or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

### Example 1:

**Input:** `n = 2`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top:
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

### Example 2:

**Input:** `n = 3`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top:
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

### Constraints:

- \(1 \leq n \leq 45\)

### Solutions

#### My solution: Recursive (Time Limit Exceeded)
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        def count_stairs(num):
            if num == 1 or num == 0:
                return 1
            else:
                return count_stairs(num - 1) + count_stairs(num - 2)
        
        return count_stairs(n)
```

**Explanation:** This solution uses a simple recursive approach, but it has exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations. It is not efficient for larger inputs.

#### Solution 2: Memoization
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        return self.count_stairs(n, {})

    def count_stairs(self, num: int, calculated_stairs: dict[int, int]) -> int:
        if num == 0 or num == 1:
            return 1

        if num not in calculated_stairs:
            calculated_stairs[num] = self.count_stairs(num - 1, calculated_stairs) + self.count_stairs(num - 2, calculated_stairs)
        
        return calculated_stairs[num]
```

**Explanation:** This solution uses memoization to store intermediate results, which helps avoid redundant calculations and improves performance compared to the basic recursive approach.

#### Solution 3: Dynamic Programming (Optimal)
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 1

        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
        
        return dp[-1]
```

**Explanation:** This solution uses dynamic programming with an iterative approach to achieve linear time complexity and constant space complexity. It is the most efficient solution.
