### Problem: Kth Largest Element in an Array

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Description:**
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the k-th largest element in the array. Note that it is the k-th largest element in the sorted order, not the k-th distinct element.

**Constraints:**
- \(1 \leq k \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^5\)
- \(-10^4 \leq \text{nums[i]} \leq 10^4\)

**Examples:**

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** `nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4]`, `k = 2`
   - **Output:** `5`

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** `nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6]`, `k = 4`
   - **Output:** `4`

**Objective:**
Can you solve this problem without sorting the entire array?

### Solution

To solve this problem efficiently, you can use a min-heap. The idea is to maintain a min-heap of size `k` such that the heap contains the `k` largest elements seen so far. The root of this heap (the smallest of the `k` largest elements) will be the k-th largest element of the array.

**Approach:**

1. **Initialize the Min-Heap:**
   - Start by adding the first `k` elements of the array to the min-heap.

2. **Process Remaining Elements:**
   - For each remaining element in the array, if the element is greater than the smallest element in the heap (i.e., the root), replace the root with this new element and re-adjust the heap.

3. **Retrieve the Result:**
   - After processing all elements, the root of the heap will be the k-th largest element.

**Python Implementation:**

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        min_heap = []
        
        # Build a min-heap with the first k elements
        for i in range(k):
            min_heap.append(nums[i])
        
        heapq.heapify(min_heap)  # Convert the list into a heap

        # Process the remaining elements
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > min_heap[0]:  # If the current element is larger than the smallest element in the heap
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)  # Remove the smallest element
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, nums[i])  # Add the new element
        
        # The root of the heap is the k-th largest element
        return min_heap[0]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Heap Initialization:** We first add the first `k` elements to the min-heap. This ensures our heap has the `k` largest elements from the beginning.

2. **Updating the Heap:** As we iterate through the remaining elements, we compare each with the smallest element in the heap (the root). If an element is larger, it means it should be included in the top `k` largest elements. Thus, we remove the smallest element and add the new one.

3. **Result:** After processing all elements, the smallest element in the heap will be the k-th largest element in the array, as it is the root of our min-heap containing the `k` largest elements.

This solution efficiently handles the problem in \(O(n \log k)\) time complexity, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array and \(k\) is the size of the heap.
