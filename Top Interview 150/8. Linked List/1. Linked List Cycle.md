**141. Linked List Cycle**

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Linked List, Two Pointers

---

**Problem Description:**

Given the `head` of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

A cycle exists if there is some node in the list that can be revisited by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node to which the tail's `next` pointer is connected. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

---

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** `head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** The cycle in the linked list connects the tail to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** `head = [1,2], pos = 0`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** The cycle in the linked list connects the tail to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** `head = [1], pos = -1`
- **Output:** `false`
- **Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

---

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked list.

**Follow-Up:**  
Can you solve it using O(1) (constant) memory?

### Python Solution:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        tortoise = head
        hare = head

        while hare and hare.next:
            tortoise = tortoise.next
            hare = hare.next.next

            if tortoise == hare:
                return True

        return False
```


### Solution 1: **Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)**
This is the algorithm used in the original code, but let's refine it slightly for clarity.

#### Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False
        
        slow = head
        fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

            if slow == fast:
                return True

        return False
```

#### Why it's good:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) – The algorithm traverses the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) – It uses constant space, which is ideal.
- **Reasoning:** This is the most efficient solution for this problem because it does not require any extra space (unlike using a hash table) and detects the cycle as soon as the fast pointer meets the slow pointer.

### Solution 2: **Hash Table Approach**

This approach involves storing the nodes you've seen in a hash table (or a set) and checking if any node repeats. If a node repeats, it means there's a cycle.

#### Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        visited_nodes = set()
        current_node = head

        while current_node:
            if current_node in visited_nodes:
                return True
            visited_nodes.add(current_node)
            current_node = current_node.next

        return False
```

#### Why it might be better:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) – It also traverses the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) – It uses additional space to store the visited nodes.
- **Reasoning:** While this solution is less space-efficient than the Tortoise and Hare approach, it's easier to understand and implement for some developers. It might also be more intuitive for debugging because it explicitly keeps track of nodes seen so far.

### Solution 3: **Modifying the Linked List (Marking Visited Nodes)**
This approach involves modifying the linked list by marking visited nodes temporarily. You can either alter the node's value to a special marker or change the `next` pointer to point to itself.

#### Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        current_node = head

        while current_node:
            if current_node.val == float('inf'):
                return True
            current_node.val = float('inf')
            current_node = current_node.next

        return False
```

#### Why it might be better:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) – It also traverses the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) – It uses constant space.
- **Reasoning:** This approach can be useful when memory is highly constrained, and you're allowed to modify the linked list. However, it has a significant downside: it alters the original linked list, which might not be acceptable in many scenarios.

### Comparison and Conclusion

- **Floyd's Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare)** is generally the best solution because it provides the optimal balance of time and space complexity (O(n) time and O(1) space) without modifying the list. It's also a standard solution to the cycle detection problem.
  
- **Hash Table Approach** is easier to understand and debug, but it uses extra space, making it less efficient in memory-constrained environments.

- **Modifying the Linked List** is a niche solution that can be useful in very specific situations where altering the list is allowed and constant space usage is crucial. However, it has the downside of being destructive to the original list.

In most cases, **Floyd's Cycle Detection** is the preferred method due to its efficiency and non-destructive nature.
