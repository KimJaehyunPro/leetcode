**104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree**

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Tree, Depth-First Search

---

**Problem Description:**

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

---

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
- **Output:** `3`

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** `root = [1,null,2]`
- **Output:** `2`

---

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

---

### Your Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:

        def findDepth(tree, depth):
            depth += 1
            if tree.left and tree.right:
                return max(findDepth(tree.left, depth), findDepth(tree.right, depth))
            elif tree.left:
                return findDepth(tree.left, depth)
            elif tree.right:
                return findDepth(tree.right, depth)
            else:
                return depth
        
        if root is None:
            return 0
            
        depth = 0
        return findDepth(root, depth)
```

### Explanation

- **Approach:** This solution uses a recursive helper function `findDepth` to traverse the tree and calculate the depth. The depth is incremented by 1 at each node, and the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees is computed recursively.
  
- **Pros:** It correctly calculates the maximum depth by checking both left and right children at each node.
  
- **Cons:** The function could be optimized for readability and simplicity. There's unnecessary code and checks that could be simplified.

### Improved Solutions

#### **Solution 1: Simplified Recursive Approach**

A more concise and straightforward recursive solution can achieve the same goal with less code.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0
        else:
            left_depth = self.maxDepth(root.left)
            right_depth = self.maxDepth(root.right)
            return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1
```

**Why it's better:**

- **Simplicity:** The code is more concise and easier to understand. It avoids unnecessary condition checks and focuses on the core logic.
- **Efficiency:** This solution is as efficient as the original, with O(n) time complexity where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Readability:** The structure of the code is cleaner, making it easier to follow.

#### **Solution 2: Iterative Approach Using Depth-First Search (DFS) with Stack**

This solution uses an iterative approach with a stack, which might be preferable in some cases to avoid potential stack overflow with deep recursion.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0
        
        stack = [(root, 1)]
        max_depth = 0
        
        while stack:
            node, depth = stack.pop()
            if node:
                max_depth = max(max_depth, depth)
                stack.append((node.left, depth + 1))
                stack.append((node.right, depth + 1))
        
        return max_depth
```

**Why it's better:**

- **Iterative Approach:** This solution avoids recursion, which can be beneficial for trees with a large depth where recursion might lead to a stack overflow.
- **Control Over Execution:** The iterative approach gives you more control over the execution process, such as managing the stack and keeping track of depths.

---

### Conclusion

- **Recursive Solution:** The simplified recursive solution is generally the best due to its simplicity and directness.
- **Iterative Solution:** The DFS iterative solution is an excellent alternative when you want to avoid the risk of recursion depth issues and prefer more control over the process.

Both solutions have the same time complexity (O(n)) and space complexity (O(h), where h is the height of the tree), but the choice between them depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
