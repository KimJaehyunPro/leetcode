# Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)

A trie (pronounced "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. It is particularly useful for applications such as autocomplete and spellcheckers.

You need to implement the `Trie` class with the following methods:

1. **`Trie()`**: Initializes the trie object.
2. **`void insert(String word)`**: Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
3. **`boolean search(String word)`**: Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
4. **`boolean startsWith(String prefix)`**: Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

#### Example

```plaintext
Input
["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]

Output
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]
```

#### Explanation

- `Trie trie = new Trie();`
- `trie.insert("apple");` — Inserts "apple" into the trie.
- `trie.search("apple");` — Returns `true` as "apple" is inserted.
- `trie.search("app");` — Returns `false` as "app" is not yet inserted.
- `trie.startsWith("app");` — Returns `true` as there is a word "apple" with the prefix "app".
- `trie.insert("app");` — Inserts "app" into the trie.
- `trie.search("app");` — Returns `true` as "app" is now inserted.

### Constraints

- \(1 \leq \text{word.length}, \text{prefix.length} \leq 2000\)
- `word` and `prefix` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- At most \(3 \times 10^4\) calls in total will be made to `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.

### Python Code Implementation

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    
    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True
    
    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.is_end_of_word
    
    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return True
```

### Usage

```python
# Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
obj = Trie()
obj.insert(word)
param_2 = obj.search(word)
param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix)
```

The Trie implementation provided is already quite efficient, but let's explore whether there are any potential improvements or alternative approaches to consider.

### Potential Improvements

1. **Space Efficiency:**
   - **Original Code:** The `TrieNode` class uses a dictionary (`children`) to store child nodes. While this is straightforward and provides O(1) average time complexity for insertions and lookups, it can be space-inefficient due to the overhead of Python dictionaries.
   - **Improvement:** Using a fixed-size list for the children if we limit the trie to lowercase English letters can save space. Each node would then only need an array of size 26 (one slot per letter).

2. **Code Structure:**
   - The original implementation separates the `TrieNode` and `Trie` classes. This is good for clarity, but combining them into a single class can sometimes simplify the design, though it might be less modular.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **Original Code:** Handles edge cases well, but depending on specific use cases, additional optimizations might be required.

Here's an alternative solution with an array-based approach for storing children nodes, which can be more space-efficient for fixed character sets like lowercase English letters:

### Alternative Solution

In this implementation, we use a list of size 26 to represent children nodes, which is more memory-efficient than using dictionaries:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = [None] * 26  # One slot for each letter in the alphabet
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    
    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            index = ord(char) - ord('a')  # Calculate the index for the character
            if not node.children[index]:
                node.children[index] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[index]
        node.is_end_of_word = True
    
    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            index = ord(char) - ord('a')
            if not node.children[index]:
                return False
            node = node.children[index]
        return node.is_end_of_word
    
    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            index = ord(char) - ord('a')
            if not node.children[index]:
                return False
            node = node.children[index]
        return True
```

### Advantages of the Array-Based Approach

1. **Memory Efficiency:**
   - **Array vs. Dictionary:** The fixed-size array (list) is generally more memory-efficient than a dictionary for storing child nodes. With a dictionary, each key-value pair has additional overhead, while an array only requires the space for the list itself.

2. **Access Time:**
   - **Array Access:** Accessing an element in a list is O(1) and can be slightly faster compared to dictionary lookups, which may have additional overhead due to hashing.

3. **Simplified Code:**
   - **Code Complexity:** The array-based approach simplifies the code by avoiding the need to handle dynamic keys. It is straightforward when the character set is limited and known in advance.

### Disadvantages

1. **Limited Flexibility:**
   - **Character Set Restriction:** This approach assumes a fixed character set (e.g., lowercase English letters). If you need to support a larger or variable character set, this solution might not be suitable without modifications.

2. **Memory Usage for Large Alphabets:**
   - **Increased Space:** For larger alphabets (e.g., Unicode characters), this approach could lead to excessive memory usage due to the large array size needed for each node.

In summary, the array-based approach is a good improvement for the specific case of lowercase English letters, providing better space efficiency and potentially faster access times. However, if you need to handle a broader character set or dynamic requirements, the dictionary-based approach may be more suitable.

## Best solution

Your provided implementation is a simplified and elegant solution for a Trie data structure using a dictionary to store children nodes. It is indeed clean and easy to understand. Here's a beautified version of your code:

```python
class Trie:

    def __init__(self):
        self.trie = {}

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        trie = self.trie
        for char in word:
            if char not in trie:
                trie[char] = {}
            trie = trie[char]
        trie["X"] = True  # Mark the end of the word

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        trie = self.trie
        for char in word:
            if char not in trie:
                return False
            trie = trie[char]
        return "X" in trie  # Check if the word ends here

    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        trie = self.trie
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in trie:
                return False
            trie = trie[char]
        return True  # Check if the prefix exists
```

### Why This Solution Might Be Faster:

1. **Simplicity and Direct Mapping:**
   - The dictionary-based implementation is straightforward and avoids the overhead of additional objects or complex data structures. Each node in the Trie is directly represented by a dictionary, which can be faster to manipulate and access.

2. **Memory Usage:**
   - Using a dictionary to represent children nodes is efficient in terms of space, especially when the alphabet is large or when many nodes have sparse children. Each node only holds references to its immediate children, reducing unnecessary space usage compared to a fixed-size array for large alphabets.

3. **Dynamic Nature:**
   - The dictionary allows for a dynamic and flexible structure, meaning that only the necessary nodes are created and stored. This can be more memory-efficient in cases where the Trie has a large but sparse dataset.

4. **Implementation Simplicity:**
   - The implementation uses simple dictionary operations which are typically very fast due to Python's efficient dictionary implementation. This simplicity often translates to better performance for many operations.

5. **Avoiding Extra Overhead:**
   - The code does not use additional attributes or objects for nodes beyond what is necessary for Trie operations. This minimizes the overhead compared to other implementations that might include extra features or complexity.

### Key Points to Consider

- **Dictionary Lookup Efficiency:** Dictionary operations (like insertions and lookups) are average O(1) in time complexity, which means both the `insert` and `search` operations in your Trie are very efficient.
  
- **End-of-Word Marker:** The use of a special marker ("X") to indicate the end of a word is a simple and effective way to distinguish complete words from prefixes. This is straightforward and easy to check.

In summary, your dictionary-based Trie implementation is fast due to its simplicity, direct mapping, efficient dictionary operations, and minimal overhead. It efficiently handles typical Trie operations with a clean and easy-to-understand code structure.
